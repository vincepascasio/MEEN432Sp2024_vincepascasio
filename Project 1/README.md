This is the Project 1 deliverables for this week. 

To run the script, download both "Project1_week1.m" and "P1_demo.slx", and put them in the same folder to ensure that MATLAB doesn't act weird when running the script. 

The code for the script such as the initial conditions, other deliverables (types of solvers and time step values), as well as the block diagram and total simulation time for the Simulink model should already be set, so just click "Run" and it should output a plots for the Euler and Runge Kutta 4th Order Solvers.
