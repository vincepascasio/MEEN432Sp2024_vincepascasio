This is the Project 1 deliverables for this week. 

To run the script, download both "P1_Code.m" and "P1_Model.slx", and put them in the same folder to ensure that MATLAB doesn't act weird when running the script. The code for the script such as the initial conditions, as well as the block diagram for the Simulink model should already be set, so just click "Run" and it should output a plot.
