This is the Project 1 deliverables for this week. 

To run the script, download both "Project1_week1.m" and "P1_demo.slx", and put them in the same folder to ensure that MATLAB doesn't act weird when running the script. 

The code for the script such as the initial conditions, other deliverables (types of solvers and time step values), as well as the block diagram and total simulation time for the Simulink model should already be set, so just click "Run" and it should output 6 plots for the Euler and Runge Kutta 4th Order Solvers at the 3 different fixed time steps. 

## Week 1 Feedback (5/5):
Great job guys! Keep it up for week 2, ya'll are on track! Only suggestion would be to now look into logic on how you can determine if your applied torque is constant, or sinusoidal. Also, make sure plots have proper axis titles!

This is the Project 1 Week 2 deliverables. 

We tried tweaking the block diagram on Simulink to account for the constant and sinusoidal torque, but we had some trouble getting it to work. The script we wrote in MATLAB didn't account for the other plots needed for this week, but it had some code regarding the CPU time and getting data.
