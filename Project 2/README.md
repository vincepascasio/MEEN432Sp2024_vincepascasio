## Project 2 Week 1 Submission

For this week, the team was tasked to plot a generated race track that had given measurements for the sections. The sections consisted of two
curved sections and 2 straightaway sections. Download the "Animate.m" file to display the animated line and the vehicle's path along the 
generated track.
