# Project 3 Week 1 and Week 2 Deliverables
This is Project week 1 and week 2 deliverables. Download the following files and put them in a folder for MATLAB/Simulink to run smoothly: the files are "init.m", "P3init.m", "initDriveCycleUrban.m", "initDriveCycleHighway.m", "p3runsim.m", and "p3_w1_car.slx". The goal for these deliverables were to build a longitudinal vehicle model in Simulink that features a driver model that follows a desired driver cycle, powertrain and brake system, and urban and highway drive cycles according to EPA, where the driver follows a desired speed within a +/- 3 mph band. Additionally, an electric motor is currently being built to be integrated into the longitudinal vehicle dynamics. The powertrain model will consist of a motor and single speed transmission. The model right helps predict the energy consumed by the vehicle when driving on 2 EPA cycles, and we assume that there is no regenerative braking and that there is an infinite source of power for the motor.
